Who was Lucy Parsons?
=====================

She was a famous labor organizer and anarchist in Chicago during the late 19th century. Once described as "more dangerous than a thousand rioters" by Chicago Police and helped found the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a major labor union. Recommend reading the book "An American revolutionary" by Carolyn Ashbaugh on her life.
