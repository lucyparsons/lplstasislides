Who was Lucy Parsons?
=====================

She was a famous labor organizer and anarchist in Chicago during the late 19th century. Once described as "more dangerous than a thousand rioters" by Chicago Police and helped found the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a major labor union. Recommend reading the book "An American Revolutionary" by Carolyn Ashbaugh on her life.

OpenOversight
=============

* Many complaints are thrown out due to no badge number or name being associated with a complaint 

* Want to build a tool to help people identify officers when filing police complaints

* Accomplish this through a database of officers and photos constructed through public data

* Web application with two use cases: Complainants use to construct a digital line up to find the officer, people submit new images of officers to keep the data up to date
